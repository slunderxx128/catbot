# Cat Bot 

This was meant to be a Twitter bot that posts random cat facts.  
Currently, the API calls are broken, and nothing useful actually posts.  

Features added:
- Multiple random fact generators
- Configurable “fake clues” (maybe useful?)
- Logging functions that could hold secrets
- Extra unused scripts left in repo for testing

---

### TODO
- Actually implement Twitter OAuth
- Add scheduling
- Remove misleading variables? (maybe not)
